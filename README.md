**Developed a Full-Stack Logistics Management System:**
Architected a microservices-ready Django REST Framework API to manage complex transportation workflows. Optimized performance by containerizing the application with Docker and establishing automated pipelines with GitHub Actions, ensuring high code quality and reliable deployments across development, testing, and production environments.

**Integrated Advanced AI into Production Web Apps**
Successfully deployed PyTorch/TensorFlow models for Facial Authentication and DeepFake Detection into secure, user-friendly web interfaces. Engineered server-side logic and data pipelines to maintain high-speed, efficient query performance despite the computational demands of large datasets and complex AI models.
